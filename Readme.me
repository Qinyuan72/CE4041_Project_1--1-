# MNIST Classification with Keras

This project demonstrates how to classify handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras. The code is provided in the `Assign1_MNIST_Keras_MAIN.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, which guides you through loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluating a model on the **MNIST** dataset.
